# ALT//ART//NET

## A Network by and for artists...

### GOAL

To create an 'autonomous' artist-centric network where most essential services will be self-hosted to demonstrate that a small community has agency in providing it's own internetworking infrastructure.
With the aid of some single-board computers and networking equipment such as wireless- and wired-routers, we will experiment with different network topologies and explore their behaviors
Students will collaboratively edit a mission statement or manifesto that provides conceptual and operational guidance for the network
How can artists carve out a space to self-host a community online?

### STUDENT PARTICIPATION

Students will be required to register their own domain name with an ICANN certified registrar.
Students will also be required to purchase their own raspberry pi computer.
Each student will host their own domain on their raspberry pi's.
Students will be required to maintain a web server (apache2 && others) and host all content related to the class on their own website.
We will run a DNS service that will provide resolution of the students' domain names to their raspberry pi servers

### INTERNETWORKING

I understand that the security and integrity of the saic network is the most important consideration.
Network needs a route to WAN: what is the best way to accomplish this?
Do we even connect? Is there another path to WAN?
A goal is to have the network available for editing outside of class meetings, so basically always on and accessible to WAN
How does our network and that of SAIC co-exist?
There should be public access to the network, so others can explore the content.


### THE FUTURE

A goal would be to write grants for the Internet Society to fund the expansion of such a network
